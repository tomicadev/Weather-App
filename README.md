Weather App
This Weather App is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) application that allows users to check the current weather for any city worldwide. Developed using PyQt5, it incorporates data fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API to provide real-time weather information including temperature, weather description, and relevant weather emojis.

Features
-City Input: Users can enter the name of a city to get the current weather information.
-Weather Information Display: Displays temperature (in Celsius), weather description, and an emoji representing the weather condition.
-Error Handling: Comprehensive error messages to handle various potential issues such as invalid city names or network problems.
-Responsive Design: The application layout adjusts for a centered window on the user's screen, providing a user-friendly experience.
Technologies Used
-Python
-PyQt5 for GUI development
-Requests library for making HTTP requests
-OpenWeatherMap API for weather data
-dotenv to manage API keys securely
Learning Goals
This project serves as a practical exercise in Python programming and GUI development. It aims to reinforce concepts such as:
-Working with APIs and handling JSON data.
-Creating a responsive user interface using PyQt5.
-Implementing error handling and user input validation.
